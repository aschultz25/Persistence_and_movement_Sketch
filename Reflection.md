Missing a few classes set me back, so I had to do my own research to understand the assignment. I knew how to do a call to random, but I wasn't sure how to track change over time or use variables to store values. I understood the idea of it, but I still wasn't confident with applying it into my own code. That part of the process was pretty challenging. Additionally, I wanted to be able to change the color and direction of the ball with my mouse click, which I had to troubleshoot and teach myself how to do. Eventually, I successfully figured it out. 
Conditionals allowed me to make the ball change direction and color when it hit the edges of the canvas or when the mouse was pressed. Specifically, I used "if statements" to check if the ballâ€™s position exceeded the canvas boundaries, and then I reversed its speed and changed its color. This makes a lot more sense now than it did before. Its just basic logic that seemed very intimidating at first! I am very proud that I was able to figure out the code despite missing class and not knowing how to do it.
